# Personal Trading Dashboard

This project is a Next.js 14 (App Router) scaffold for a margin backtesting dashboard. It includes placeholder components, API routes, and library stubs for future development.

## Getting Started

Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

The app exposes pages for the main dashboard (`/`) and a simple screener (`/screener`).
