# Personal Trading Dashboard

This project is a responsive Next.js 14 (App Router) dashboard for modeling margin strategies on both desktop and mobile devices. The initial strategy implemented is **dividend farming on margin**, which tracks reinvested dividends, tax accruals, and portfolio metrics over time.

## Getting Started

Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

The app exposes pages for the main dashboard (`/`) and a simple screener (`/screener`).
