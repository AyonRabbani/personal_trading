# Trading Research Analysis

This project is a simplified Next.js site that presents personal trading research in an investigative format. Visual widgets and complex charts have been removed in favor of concise narrative sections.

## Getting Started

Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

The application serves a single research-focused page at the root route (`/`).
